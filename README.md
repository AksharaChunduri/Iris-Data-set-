# Iris-Data-set-
Individual project-1 for DATA 1202

**## Project Title
**Iris Flower Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM)****

## Short Description 
A machine learning project that classifies Iris flower species using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV. The model evaluates accuracy through classification reports and confusion matrix visualization.

## Getting Started
This project involves reading the Iris dataset, preprocessing it, training a model using SVM, tuning hyperparameters, and evaluating its performance through classification metrics and a confusion matrix.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:
pandas
numpy
seaborn
matplotlib
scikit-learn

Installing
Clone this repository or download the files.
Place the Iris.csv file in the same directory as the Python file.
Run the script using any Python IDE or Jupyter environment.

Running the Tests
The model is evaluated on a hold-out test dataset using the following metrics:

Breakdown of Tests
Accuracy Score – Compares actual and predicted values.
Classification Report – Provides precision, recall, f1-score.
Confusion Matrix – Visualized using a heatmap to show prediction results for each class.

Deployment
This project is meant for educational purposes and is not deployed to any server or production environment. You can run it locally.
